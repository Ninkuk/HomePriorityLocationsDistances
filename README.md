# Home Priority Locations Distances


## About the project
Lengthy title aside, this is a basic program which will help make your house/apartment hunting process easier!
<br>
Instead of going to Google Maps to check the proximity to nearby utilities or your office, use this to chart all destinations in one go. The destinations list will be persisted and you only need to change the origin.
